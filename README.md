# Mod Collector Knowledge Object Read Me
This Knowledge Object collection packages moderator functions original developed for the Precision Feedback pipeline

## What is a moderator?
A moderator is a function, that given a comparison value and performance data, can quantify the degree of motivation a precondition is likely to produce so that a message can be ranked

*Zach - A moderator as a dial. A moderator is a function that given some inputs produces an estimate of the magnitude of influence. In causal pathways, this assess the magnitude of influence of a causal pathway. Predonditions are switches on and off. Moderators are like dials. If the causal pathway is there, the moderator asses the magnitude of it.*

**Zach - a function that indicates the magnitude of influence of some characteristic of an intervention**

Zach's paper on defining moderators and causal pathways (not the biggest fan): <https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpubh.2018.00136/full>
- Precision feedback is the implementation strategy
- *"Moderators are factors that increase or decrease the level of influence of an implementation strategy on an outcome"*


*Questions to ask*
- What exactly is a moderator?
- How do we isolate the definition of a moderator from the PFP?
- My understanding of moderators is that their function is to define the degree of motivation a precondition is likely to produce so that the choice in message for tailored feedback can be ranked and chosen. ->
- The moderator determines the predicted utility of the causal pathway
- The precondition is what already exists.
- Does the precondition need to be acknowledge in the knowledge object?
- It was noted previously that the moderator function does not need to refer to the causal pathway.

## Who are these moderators for?

*Questions to ask*
- Who will be accessing these moderators in the future?
- -> Other investigators developing precision audit and feedback programs?
- Are there other uses for these?

## What will people use these moderators for?

*Questions to ask*
- Once we identify who these moderator functions are being packaged for, concurrently we need to ask "what will they use these for?"

## What moderators are packaged?
The following moderators are going to be packaged: *define each of these*
1. Gap size
2. Trend slope
3. Monotonic prediction

These moderators function independently

### Gap size
*Insert description*
- *inputs* - *my understanding is that these are individual performance data + peer comparison values*
- *outputs* - *this is some sort of scalar absolute value*

### Trend Slope
*Insert description*
- *inputs*
- *outputs*

### Monotonic prediction
*Insert description*
- *inputs*
- *outputs*
